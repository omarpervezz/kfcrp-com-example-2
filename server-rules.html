                           BAN PROCESS

                        <p class="commom-description">
                           Ban duration is at the discretion of the staff members, but
                           generally speaking the process for a ban is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol class="fancy_list mt-4 mb-5">

                           <li>Second offence = 1 month ban</li>
                           <li>Third offence = Permanent ban</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul class="fancy_list mt-4 mb-5">
                           <li>
                              More severe offenses can result in a permanent ban. Examples
                              of these may include hacking, exploiting, toxic behavior,
                              abusive/malicious behavior, and mass VDM or RDM.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              Upon receiving a ban, our discord bot will DM you with your
                              ban reason and the length of the ban. You will need to have
                              DMs enabled on Discord in order to receive this.
                              Alternatively, you can inquire about your ban at
                              <a

                              below) or both parties have made a mutual introduction and
                              understand why combat is occurring. Do not RDM (random death
                              match) or VDM (vehicle deathmatch). You must have a logical
                              reason for killing someone.

                              characters at all times. Therefore, your character's
                              personality and mannerisms should portray fear when faced
                              with a life threat. For example, if you have a gun pointed
                              at the back of your head, and you don't have a weapon
                              drawn?, put your hands up.

                              Instead, show respect to other players and keep the
                              real-life drama out of roleplay. Do not use derogatory

                              disabilities, or sexual preference. Do not base a
                              character's roleplay around being heavily toxic, aggressive,
                              or discriminatory.

                              other interaction can still warrant a detainment by Police

                              as that would implicate the entire group.
