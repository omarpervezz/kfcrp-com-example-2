                    "KFCRP! :D i’ve enjoyed every minute of it! Through my 3
                    characters over my time here, I’ve experienced life in an MC
                    and a cartel gang, and carried out jobs such as a mechanic,
                    PD, pilot, taxi driver and a car dealer all of which have
                    been very enjoyable. There is always something new being
                    added and support has always been great for me. The people
                    in the city are amazing too, lots of friendly and helpful
                    people about all down to have a good time. You get out, what
                    you put in here. People here are receptive, so the more
                    effort you put into your RP, the more you recieve. It’s a
                    fantastic place for newer people to come to learn more, but
                    also very enjoyable for more experienced players. I would
                    highly recommend KFC RP to anyone!"

                    "This community is absolutely AMAZING! This has been my
                    first city that I got into as an RP player and by far the
                    best and most close knit group of players i have seen
                    through multiple other servers. I have gotten invites and
                    accepted into multiple other cities and have turned them all
                    down to stick here with KFC Roleplay! The server owner Red
                    is ON TOP OF HIS GAME! Backing this server is not a
                    requirement but I have no problem putting money to this
                    server as the server owner Red puts it all 100% back into
                    this city! Constantly updating and adding multiple new
                    things to do in city, whether it be boosting, drug dealing,
