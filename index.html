                              "KFCRP! :D i’ve enjoyed every minute of it! Through my 3
                              characters over my time here, I’ve experienced life in an MC
                              and a cartel gang, and carried out jobs such as a mechanic,
                              PD, pilot, taxi driver and a car dealer all of which have
                              been very enjoyable. There is always something new being
                              added and support has always been great for me. The people
                              in the city are amazing too, lots of friendly and helpful
                              people about all down to have a good time. You get out, what
                              you put in here. People here are receptive, so the more
                              effort you put into your RP, the more you recieve. It’s a
                              fantastic place for newer people to come to learn more, but
                              also very enjoyable for more experienced players. I would
                              highly recommend KFC RP to anyone!"

                              first city that I got into as an RP player and by far the
                              best and most close knit group of players i have seen
                              through multiple other servers. I have gotten invites and
                              accepted into multiple other cities and have turned them all
                              down to stick here with KFC Roleplay! The server owner Red
                              is ON TOP OF HIS GAME! Backing this server is not a
                              requirement but I have no problem putting money to this
                              server as the server owner Red puts it all 100% back into
                              this city! Constantly updating and adding multiple new
                              things to do in city, whether it be boosting, drug dealing,
                              selling or fixing cars, become a successful business owner,

                              of it. To the interactions, to the admin taking action as
                              soon as he can on player, and bug reports. Being one person

                              and had to learn all of the terminology and what not to say,
                              I started off as your everyday citizen, got a job at PDM and
                              things only went up from there. I’ve now been here a year
                              and 9 months, I’m full time PD and I couldn’t ask for
                              anything better. I’ve made a lot of friendships in this
                              server and will continue to make more. The owner is on top
                              of things and changes are made all the time and keeps us
                              going. I would recommend joining us for some great RP

                              most recent boosting addition has been something that I
                              really enjoy doing with friends, and something that I love
                              chasing when on my PD side. I have always had quick
                              responses from the admin & they never fail to help me when I
                              need it. I have made tons of friends from this community and

                              "I’ve been in the city for about five months now and this is
                              where I’ve decided to call my RP home. There are many city
                              opportunities like EMS, PD, and gang life. I really enjoy
                              the business aspect of the city. Owning and using a business
                              for RP is the most satisfying thing for me in the city. I
                              hold my restaurants and keep up with them like a baby. This
                              is also a great place to meet new people and form beautiful
                              friendships. The staff is active and constantly making
                              changes to the city to keep up/ adapt to what the city
                              needs. I always recommend this city to people looking for a
                              good RP experience."

                              the place I knew I wanted to stay in, I was brand new to RP

                              I started off as your everyday citizen, got a job at PDM and
                              things only went up from there. I’ve now been here a year
                              and 9 months, I’m full time PD and I couldn’t ask for
                              anything better. I’ve made a lot of friendships in this
                              server and will continue to make more. The owner is on top
                              of things and changes are made all the time and keeps us
                              going. I would recommend joining us for some great RP
                              experiences and making friends from people all over the
